# Inocan Group's `eslint` Config

This is a simple and reusable configuration for **eslint** which should be used on all
Inocan Group projects (and of course everyone else is welcome to use as well). It
originates from the defaults that are now emitted as part of the Vue CLI 3.x tool when
configured for Typescript projects. We use this for both front and backend projects.
